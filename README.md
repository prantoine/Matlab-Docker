## 1. Usage Instructions

This section is intended for users of the service in the [sspcloud](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr). You need an email address of a French Higher Education institution to be able the access the service. 

**Overview:**

1. Get account on [sspcloud](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr)
2. Have valid mathworks credentials (your university should provide you with relevant credentials for this to work)
3. Import Package and Data to the data storage space.
4. Clone this repo
5. Upload `matlab.yaml` kubernetes specification to SSPcloud storage
6. Create your matlab service
7. Launch matlab service
8. Transfer output to data storage.

We only talk about points 3- here.

> You should consult the SSPcloud [documentation for starters](https://www.sspcloud.fr/catalog?path=SSPCloud␣Documentation)

### Import to Storage space

* In the left menu bar on SSPcloud, go to File Explorer
* Click on My Data
* Create new empty folder
* Upload full *uncompressed* replication package - you should use the drag and drop feature, which will preserve any folder structure. 

> Take a look at the docs about [how you will access those data](https://docs.sspcloud.fr/content/storage.html#utiliser-des-données-stockées-sur-minio)

### Clone this Repo

This will give you access to a script which you will need to upload to your `s3` bucket (`matlab_template.yaml`).

### Upload `matlab_template.yaml` to SSPcloud storage

* File Explorer > My Data
* Click Upload File
* Drag and Drop `matlab_template.yaml`. Will upload into the root of your `s3` storage system on SSPcloud.

### Create Your Matlab Service on SSPcloud

1.  One needs to create a VScode based instance on SSPcloud - choose any available (`vscode-r-python-julia` works. you need `vscode`.) We will call this the `admin-instance`. `TL;DR:` You can click on [this link](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/launcher/ide/vscode-r-python-julia?name=admin-vscode-r-python-julia&version=2.5.2&s3=region-79669f20&service.image.custom.version=«mathworks%2Fmatlab%3Ar2025b»&init.personalInit=«https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Ffloswald%2FMatlab-Docker%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Finitmatlab.sh»&kubernetes.role=«admin»&networking.user.enabled=true&networking.user.ports[0]=-&autoLaunch=true) to launch my exact instance, but for completeness here are the configurations, and the rest of the section explains creation of the service. Each point here refers to an item in the configuration list of the instance you are creating:
    1.  *Service*. Do *not* supply a custom docker container, leave whatever is the default (that one just runs VScode in admin mode for us)
    2.  *Resources*. Choose the corresponding resources.
    3.  *Persistence*. Choose the size of the disk.
    4.  *Role*. The instance needs to be configured _in admin mode_ .
    5. *Initialisation Script*. Supply an init script that uses kubernetes to launch our new matlab service. The init script I supplied is [here - initmatlab.sh](initmatlab.sh)
      this copies `matlab_template.yaml` from your SSPcloud S3 into the the current instances user space, and uses `kubectl` to launch the new custom service (`matlab`)
      To get the URL of the script, in github, just click on `raw` top right while viewing the file. Grab that URL and supply to the config.
2. Insert a *friendly name* in the top of the config panel, so you can find this easier in the future.
3. Save the service configuration in SSPcloud, so you can find it easily in the future.

### Launch the Matlab Service on SSPcloud

1.  Launch the above created `admin-instance` on SSPcloud. You see VSCode under a URL like `https://user-floswald-468664-0.user.lab.sspcloud.fr`. 
2.  On first run, this will pull my matlab docker image and build it, so it takes a while. On the console of the `admin-instance` do `kubectl get pods` to see progress.
    ```bash
    onyxia@vscode-r-python-julia-826144-0:~/work$ kubectl get pods
    NAME                             READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
    matlab-7ccb98587f-9dbv2          0/1     ContainerCreating   0          3m9s
    ```
3.   As soon as `kubectl get pods -w` reports `STATUS: Running` for the matlab service, you can point your browser to [https://user-floswald-999999-0.user.lab.sspcloud.fr](https://user-floswald-999999-0.user.lab.sspcloud.fr) and see what gives. If all went well, you will see the matlab login browser.
4.   The `matlab_template.yaml` specification sets the ingress point for kubernetes at `https://user-${VAULT_TOP_DIR}-999999-0.user.lab.sspcloud.fr`, where you will find matlab if successful. The value of `VAULT_TOP_DIR` is your Onyxia username, so you should change the URL accordingly. I _think_ you are almost free what goes for `999999-0`, but there may be some checking going on that expects a certain format for this URL - I guess at least the username must be valid.
5.   You need an institutional login (via your university for instance) that works on mathworks.com. After successful login check that you can see the toolboxes in matlab (go to `Apps`).

## 2. Implementation Details

This checklist worked for me to deploy matlab with pre-installed toolboxes via the `https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/` instance of the [Onyxia](https://www.onyxia.sh) project. 

### Objectives of Implementation

1. Provide a way to run matlab in the cloud, with toolboxes, and with browser based login.
2. Use MATLAB Online Licensing: We use _named user licensing_ with a mathworks account authentication. You need to have something like a _Matlab campuswide license_ - you log in with your institutional credentials.
3. Technically, the `-browser` flag on the matlab startup command launches `matlab-proxy` which runs the authentication workflow in your browser.

### Preparation of Docker Image and Kubernetes Setup

1. `Dockerfile` in this repo: locally builds a matlab image and preinstalls a set of toolboxes. This takes the official matlab image, and adds the matlab package installer, with instructions for which additional toolboxes to add. Edit the `products` argument in the Dockerfile.
5. built locally with: 
    ```
    docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t floswald/matlab-toolboxes:r2025b .
    ``` 
    I am using the `platform` flag because I am on Apple Silicon.
6. tested that running container locally allows to log in via browser and that toolboxes are installed and work. run locally with
    ```
    docker run --rm -it --platform linux/amd64 --shm-size=512M -p 8888:8888 floswald/matlab-toolboxes:r2025b -browser
    ```
    those instructions are from the [matlab docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mathworks/matlab).
7. `docker push floswald/matlab-toolboxes:r2025b` : make docker image available via docker hub.
8. `matlab_template.yaml`: is a kubernetes specification which sets up a service to run on SSPcloud, which uses my container from docker hub. This file needs to be placed on the SSPcloud S3 storage of the user. I followed SSPcloud instructions for storage at [https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/account/storage](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/account/storage), selecting at the bottom the env var for the `mc` client. Locally, export that env var as `MC_HOST_onyxia`, and use the `mc` client:
    ```
    # install client on mac:
    brew install minio/stable/mc

    # check onyxia client available from env var:
    floswald@PTL11077 ~/g/Matlab-Docker (main)> mc alias list
    onyxia
      URL       : https://minio.lab.sspcloud.fr
      AccessKey : ***
      SecretKey : ***
      API       : S3v4
      Path      : 
      Src       : env

    # keys are set from MC_HOST_onyxia

    # do a ls on onyxia S3 datastore
    floswald@PTL11077 ~/g/Matlab-Docker (main) [1]> mc ls onyxia/floswald

    # edit matlab.yaml locally (for your user name?), then put onto S3 at onyxia:
    mc cp matlab.yaml onyxia/floswald/matlab.yaml


## Meta

### kubectl setup on sspcloud

*  start a vscode instance in admin mode
*  that gives access to the kubernetes namespace
*  e.g. can do `kubectl get pods`
